1. You should check out your own interactive node and not abuse the logon node.
   Do this with a command like:
   `srun --pty --x11 -c 2 -p interactive -t 6:00:00 bash`

2. Kaylea will get a more convenient environment setup. However, for testing,
   the envoriment can be generated by:
   `source grace_env.sh`
   This will load the required python modules

3. Run the code with python3 ising.py [arguments]....
